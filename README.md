## Website Technical Requirements
**Tips:**
  - Remember to make regular commits and pushes. **A penalty of 40% will be deducted for unstafisfactory commits that do not demonsrate manual coding.**
  - Only use the code we have learnt in class.
  - *Don't use AI!* Instead ask for help using the Slack channel.
  - Every student submission should be unique, with its own content, design, HTML and CSS. 

### Website content must include:
- [ ] 2 pages including the homepage
- [ ] The pages’ content must be organized and laid out using content blocks as demonstrated in the flexbox and responsive layouts assignments.
- [ ] A google map embed or a video
- [ ] a web table
- [ ] a web form that includes at least 5 types of form controls (inputs).
- [ ] Images can be sourced from royalty-free stock image sites such as: 
    - https://pixabay.com
    - https://stocksnap.io
    - https://www.pexels.com
    - https://unsplash.com 
    
### Website code must include:
- [ ] All styles must be coded in one external stylesheet
- [ ] All code must be formatted
- [ ] Comments must be included in the source code to point out features and explain the code.
- [ ] At least 2 Google font families must be used (you can use as many font variants as you like)
- [ ] Every submission must feature a visibly unique design. This includes distinct choices in color palette, font pairings, visual hierarchy, and structural layout. Submissions should not share a similar aesthetic or boilerplate AI style.
- [ ] The page layouts must be coded mobile-first and include one breakpoint for screens above 1024px.
- [ ] A max-width of 1170px must be used for the layout on desktop so that the content is centered and doesn’t stretch across the whole width of the viewport.
- [ ] All anchor links must be functional.
- [ ] The navigation must be responsive and show a hamburger icon on mobile using the code from the provided responsive nav codepen.
- [ ] CSS transitions must be used. 
- [ ] The code throughout the site must demonstrate a good understanding of flexbox.
- [ ] HTML must be semantic and clean (for ex: images have alt tags). 
- [ ] CSS must be easy to read and efficient (use a clear naming convention for the classes and use CSS comments to organize the code into content blocks)

## Testing
You will need to provide screenshots of all the tests listed below. Fix errors as they occur and retest as appropriate:
- [ ] Validate your HTML for all pages: https://validator.w3.org 
- [ ] Validate your external stylesheet (by file upload): https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator 
- [ ] Check your homepage is accessible (use your published website’s URL): https://wave.webaim.org  
- [ ] Check your homepage’s page performance using Google Lighthouse

## Grading
This assignment is worth 10% of your final course grade broken down as follows: 
  - 30% for HTML
  - 40% for CSS
  - 30% for finish (uniqueness, quality of content, levels of execution and finish)

A penalty of 40% will be deducted for unstafisfactory commits that do not demonsrate manual coding.
